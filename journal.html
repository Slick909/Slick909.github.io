	<h1>My first journal entry!</h1>
	<h2>Sunday October 2nd</h2>

	<p>What I have learned so far about HTML/CSS is that it is pretty interesting especially since it isn't that hard to understand once you actually try. Molly has been a big help for learning code and making the class fun. At first I thought cs would require a lot of complicated language and typing but the basic stuff is actually pretty easy. So far I have made a website with my person card. My thoughts so far on cs1 are that its a nice and fun class that lets me learn something new and will allow me to be creative when making my own website.</p>
