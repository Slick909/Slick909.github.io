	<h1>Journal 1: Sunday, October 2nd</h1>

	<p>What I have learned so far about HTML/CSS is that it is pretty interesting especially since it isn't that hard to understand once you actually try. Molly has been a big help for learning code and making the class fun. At first I thought cs would require a lot of complicated language and typing but the basic stuff is actually pretty easy. So far I have made a website with my person card. My thoughts so far on cs1 are that its a nice and fun class that lets me learn something new and will allow me to be creative when making my own website.</p>
	
	<h1>Journal 2: Wenesday, October 12th</h2>

	<p>I have finsihed publishing my website which means I can start thinking about what I want it to look like. I'm thinking since I like movies a lot I want to incorparate different ideas from movies into my webiste. This could meen including something from a scene or adding references.</p>

	<h1>Journal 3: Sunday, October 16th</h3>

	<p>I made my first animation in a new sublime text html. I also connected it with a link like I did with my journal entries. I looked at the example animation and code Molly put on classes and used some of the code there. After putting in some of the code, I changed some of the numbers and durations. After I did this I realised that it looked similar to the dvd bouncing logo. This gave me inspiration to make something like this for a project. I still haven't quite figured out how to fully replicate the animation but I was able to make it move diagnoly. </p>

	<h1>Journal 4: November 16th</h4>

	<p>Making the card project was definitley a fun experience. I knew right away that I wanted to make a card for Jacob because I knew I could make something that he would like that would be funny. We both like a video game called modern warfare and a new one recently came out so I decided to use one of the popular characters from the game and put it next to a funny picture of jacob. After I added the pictures that would change everytime I clicked I had to add music. Since Jacob is a very big fan of the artist Yeat I knew I had to add one of his songs. After I added all those thins I added a title called spot the difference that you would see as you flipped back and forth between Jacob and the Modern Warfare character all while a Yeat song was playing.</p>
