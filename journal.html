	<h1>Journal 1: Sunday, October 2nd</h1>

	<p>What I have learned so far about HTML/CSS is that it is pretty interesting especially since it isn't that hard to understand once you actually try. Molly has been a big help for learning code and making the class fun. At first I thought cs would require a lot of complicated language and typing but the basic stuff is actually pretty easy. So far I have made a website with my person card. My thoughts so far on cs1 are that its a nice and fun class that lets me learn something new and will allow me to be creative when making my own website.</p>
	
	<h1>Journal 2: Wenesday, October 12th</h2>

	<p>I have finsihed publishing my website which means I can start thinking about what I want it to look like. I'm thinking since I like movies a lot I want to incorparate different ideas from movies into my webiste. This could meen including something from a scene or adding references.</p>

	<h1>Journal 3: Sunday, October 16th</h3>

	<p>I made my first animation in a new sublime text html. I also connected it with a link like I did with my journal entries. I looked at the example animation and code Molly put on classes and used some of the code there. After putting in some of the code, I changed some of the numbers and durations. After I did this I realised that it looked similar to the dvd bouncing logo. This gave me inspiration to make something like this for a project. I still haven't quite figured out how to fully replicate the animation but I was able to make it move diagnoly. </p>

	<h1>Journal 4: November 16th</h4>

	<p>Making the card project was definitley a fun experience. I knew right away that I wanted to make a card for Jacob because I knew I could make something that he would like that would be funny. We both like a video game called modern warfare and a new one recently came out so I decided to use one of the popular characters from the game and put it next to a funny picture of jacob. After I added the pictures that would change everytime I clicked I had to add music. Since Jacob is a very big fan of the artist Yeat I knew I had to add one of his songs. After I added all those thins I added a title called spot the difference that you would see as you flipped back and forth between Jacob and the Modern Warfare character all while a Yeat song was playing.</p>

	<h1>Journal 5: </h5>
	
	<p>I think so far the array project is my favorite. This is because it easy to make it look good and the function is a lot easier than it looks. There are a lot of things you can do with the array and I decided to make it choose a random movie from a selection of my favorites. There is still more I can do with the project like replacing the text with the Movie poster.</p>

	<h1>Journal 6: </h6>

	<p>The valentines project has defintliey been a fun one. I always thinks its fun to make something for someone else especially when its somone your chill with and you can make something funny that they won't be offended by. I chose Carlos as the person I am making the project for because he is one of the less annoying freshman and a funny kid.</p>

	<h1>Journal 7: February 25th</h7>

	<p>At first when making the car project I was a little annoyed because my code wasn't working the way I wanted it to and I only had the little blue box that moved to the right. After sitting down in my scheduled Molly lab and tried to actually change and add things to my code it started to work more in my favor. I'm now at a point with the project where I have a car that moves in the direction I want across another background image. This experince has showed me that if I actually sit down and dedictate my time to solving the problem the results will be rewarding.</p>

	<h1>Journal 8: June 1st</h8>

	<p>I would say it has been a fullfilling year in CS1, I learned a lot, and not just in coding, I learned a lot about how to approach things in general, and how to explore my creative ideas. I won't be going on to CS2 and I don't think I will continue coding, but that doesn't mean I think CS1 was for nothing, it was one of the only classes I genuinley enjoyed this year. While I may forget how to code in these next few years, I definitley won't forget the crazy stories and insightful life lesson Molly provided in class. That's all.</p>
